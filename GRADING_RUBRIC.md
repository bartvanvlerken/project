Is the interpretation of the analysis correct?

- [x] Interpretation is correct, detailed, complete, and is clearly communicated to the reader [Grade Range 8 - 10]
- [ ] Interpretation is adequate: largely correct, detailed, and complete, but minor mistakes in interpretation are made or additional insights should be derived from the analysis [Grade Range 6 - 8]
- [ ] Interpretation contains serious mistakes and/or misses out on main points [Grade Range 0 - 5]

**Grader Feedback (if any)**

* Highly creative and original research idea, with extensive data collection - very useful to answer the RQ 
* Operationalization is well done
* No pdf handed in, that's a pity. The video is good 

**FINAL GRADE: 8.75 / 10**
